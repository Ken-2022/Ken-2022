- 👋 Hi, I’m @Ken-2022
- 👀 I’m interested in the idea of software engineering.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning CS50 from HarvardX, online free course
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate or any mentorship. 
- 📫 How to reach me ...
- I am a Registered Mechanical Engineering but for the past few years I'm not happy where I am. So I decided to learn Software Egineering.
- Eversince highschool, I am more comfortable using PC and any related topics or activity. ME was just my uncle's decision.
